description: Community-Based, Open Source, Full-Featured Network Operating System.
  OpenSwitch provides a fully-featured L2/L3 control plane stack, traditional and
  programmatic, declarative control plane. The 24x7 nature of global digital economy
  and the explosion of data have changed how we think about data center networking.
  It&rsquo;s time for the separation of switch hardware and software&mdash;delivered
  through an open environment based on open source established practices and true
  community involvement from developers and users.
